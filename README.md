### 1. About the API
***
The goal of the API is to let users create a project. For each project, the author of
the project can add as many contributors as he/she wants. Note that only the author of
the project is allowed to add contributors. Of course, a user can also create as many
projects as they want. Within a project, the author and the contributors can create
issues associated to the project. For each issue, the author of the project and
the contributors can make comments.
